# SimpleMVC
A simple php MVC framework built from scratch to be similar with the conventions used in Laravel.

This is just a pet project to anable me get an idea about how laravel works behind the scenes. [doings.txt](https://github.com/ovurevu/SimpleMVC/blob/main/doings.txt) explains the commit history and changes.

Dive-in and enjoy at your own peril. :smile:
